            What makes our coffee different? 
        </h2>
        <p>
            At Cafe Kitten we want to take responsibility for the full coffee circle to ensure we are part of a sustainable coffee future. The first step towards this is to create and maintain good relationships with our farmers, to know where our coffee has grown and under what conditions. We believe that close relationships and cooperation is the way towards transparency and sustainability in the value chain of coffee.
        </p>  
        <p>
            We are serious about providing our guests a high quality, sustainable product assortment relevant for each country. Our core product, coffee, is sourced from different coffee regions around the world and then carefully roasted in our own roastery. We serve our coffee both hot and cold, in different sizes and flavours, with seasonal relevance and to the taste of our guests.
        </p>  
        <p>
            At Cafe Kitten, we think that only the best quality is good enough for our guests. Therefore, we have decided to only serve Specialty Coffee from selected farms and cooperatives. Specialty Coffee means that the coffee scores at least 80 points on a 1-100 scale, which makes it the highest quality coffee in the world according to the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA).
