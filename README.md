### Features Left to Implement
Could be fun to add a little shop section with check out of pick up. 

## Testing

###  Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

### Unfixed Bugs
For the menu images I first thought that an alt attribute would be enough but the more research I did the more I saw it wasn't. Especially since the meny has vital information. I couldn't fully understand how to make what I needed possible.

## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings, navigate to the left to the Pages 
From the source section drop-down menu, select the main branch
Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
